/*
Prepping Data Challenge: Bike Sales (week 1)
This week's focus is on cleaning the dataset, and make them ready to answer some questions from our stakeholders.

Requirement:
1. Connect and load the csv file.
2. Split the 'Store-Bike' field into 'Store' and 'Bike'
3. Clean up the 'Bike' field to leave just three values in the 'Bike' field (Mountain, Gravel, Road)
4. Create two different cuts of the date field: 'quarter' and 'day of month'
5. Remove the first 10 orders as they are test values
6. Output the data as a csv
