    "### Prepping Data Challenge: Timesheet checks (week 17)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Challenge \n",
    "My employees log their hours daily and are contracted to 8 hours per week so I want to check their average number of hours worked over the last 2 weeks. Also, I allow for 20% of their time (not including Chats) to work on their own special projects, meaning they should be spending at least 80% of their time on Client items of work, so I also want to check that they are sticking to instructions by calculating the % of total hours spent on Client work. The task has three sets of requirements as the stakeholder is quite specific.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Requirements\n",
    " - Remove the ‘Totals’ Rows\n",
    " - Pivot Dates to rows and rename fields 'Date' and 'Hours'\n",
    " - Split the ‘Name, Age, Area of Work’ field into 3 Fields and Rename\n",
    " - Remove unnecessary fields\n",
    " - Remove the row where Dan was on Annual Leave and check the data type of the Hours Field.\n",
    " - Total up the number of hours spent on each area of work for each date by each employee.\n",
    "\n",
    " - First we are going to work out the avg number of hours per day worked by each employee\n",
    "   - Calculate the total number of hours worked and days worked per person\n",
    "   - Calculate the avg hours and remove unnecessary fields.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Now we are going to work out what % of their day (not including Chats) was spend on Client work.\n",
    "   - Filter out Work related to Chats.\n",
    "   - Calculate total number of hours spent working on each area for each employee\n",
    "   - Calculate total number of hours spent working on both areas together for each employee\n",
    "   - Join these totals together\n",
    "   - Calculate the % of total and remove unnecessary fields\n",
    "   - Filter the data to just show Client work\n",
    "   - Join to the table with Avg hours to create your final output"
